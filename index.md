# How Stressful

## Hi, my name is not Segfault

### About

Hi, my online handle is Segfault. I sometimes go by gahjouyooj, uytdsheffhgewf, ukccdeb49f, Renjian-buchai, or How Stressful.

I program, update wikis, and occasionally translate manga.

Feel free to communicate me with English or Chinese.

#### Entertainment

Games I enjoy playing (Approximately in descending order of preference)

- Arcaea
- Phigros
- Muse Dash
- Osu (Mania)
- Lanota
- Osu (STD, Taiko, CTB)
- Honkai: Star Rail

I also enjoyed The Beginner\'s Guide greatly.
Its replay value isn\'t great, so I may very well get bored of it, thus I don\'t really play it often.
Strongly recommend, ties with Arcaea in enjoyment

___

Books and **manga** I enjoy reading (Same ordering)

- The King\'s Avatar
- **Oyasumi Punpun**
- **Otaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii**
- **Sometimes, Even Reality is a Lie!**
- **I Only Want to Beat You**
- What if? (The one by Randall Munroe, not the Marvel one)

___

Unfortunately or otherwise, I program in C++.

Somehow, I\'ve also managed to find programming in C++ *fun*. Probably because I hate myself.

Template errors yay.
