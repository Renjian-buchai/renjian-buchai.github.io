# Arcaea

Hi, I play Arcaea. In fact, I\'ve been playing for a short time. Of 7 years. I didn\'t realise it\'s been that long, but I have memories of buying Vicious Labyrinth when it released, and that\'s apparently 7 years ago.

Holy shit, I\'m getting old.

Still potential 11 at the time of writing. Insert skill issue here.

In my defense, I\'m a thumb player, and thumb players are worse at speed. Bengalee is an exception to this.

Because my speed is not ideal, I\'ve spent a large part of my time optimising my movements, analysing charts, and figuring out anomalies. Figuring out anomalies is difficult when you\'re doing it on your own without any help from the official wiki. Ask me how I know.

I play with colourblind mode on, not because I\'m colourblind, but because I prefer the colour scheme.

I can\'t read light-side charts at all.

Axium crisis is the easiest 10+. Fight me on that.

## Tips and Tricks

Most of the tips and tricks are updated from [this blog](https://shizukunoshinden.carrd.co/#arc) by Marina. I do recommend you read it if you want information about pack purchases. The tips and tricks will be repeated here, including anything I have to add.

## Skillsets

As with all rhythm games, the gameplay can be split into different skillsets.

In Arcaea, skillsets are usually split into 2 categories:

### Accuracy

Accuracy is the ability to set \'high score\' plays, usually an EX+ on charts at your current skill level.
Some definitions also claim that PMs are the criteria for the play to be \'high score\'.
Almost no definitions claim that max PMs are the criteria for \'high score\' plays.

Unless you\'re Aploplex.

In the extreme case, the ideal accuracy player could get PM on 9s every time, but get Bs or Cs in 9+s.

___

### Stamina

Unlike other games, Arcaea players consider stamina to be your ability to set average or above scores.

This sounds like a weaker version of accuracy, but stamina is more about your ability to barely pass harder charts.

In the extreme case, the ideal stamina player could AA or low EX every chart, but they can\'t hit EX+ on any chart.

___

It\'s not easy to figure out how good your accuracy or stamina is. It isn\'t necessarily beneficial to find out, either.

You should judge your skill based on your ***average*** ability, **not** your *strongest* ability, **nor** your *weakest* ability!

Potential doesn\'t really say much about whether you\'re an accuracy player, nor a stamina player.
As stated by Marina, you don\'t actually need to play charts >10 until 12.00 ptt, nor PM anything until 12.5 ptt.

Most players tend to be biased towards accuracy, but there\'s nothing wrong with being a stamina player.

___

To improve accuracy, you can try to PM lower-level charts, even PST or PRS charts.
Shiny PURE percentage is an OK gauge of accuracy on charts you have PMed before[^1].

To improve stamina, you can try playing hard charts **that you can read**.
If you can\'t read the chart, please don\'t play it. You\'ll build bad muscle memory[^2]<sup>,</sup>[^3].

As stated by Marina, you should focus on the other skillset when you\'re having trouble on one skillset.
Most people improve the quickest when they work on a variety of skillsets at once.

## Miscellaneous Tips

A lot of these tips have parts that are directly quoted from Marina.
If they\'re quoted directly, I\'ll place them in quote blocks.
Anything I add or rephrase will either be outside the quote blocks, or in `code blocks`.

## How do I improve at

### Anything in general

> Play all the charts you can, as long as you can read them. And play frequently if you can! The only `reliable` way to get better at rhythm games is by playing them.

Remember that frequently and constantly do **not** have the same meaning!
Playing the games 10 hours a day every day may not help you improve over long periods of time.
Your muscles have to rest, and rhythm games require rather intense concentration.

Playing over and over again might also cause mind block.
If you retry a pattern you misread over and over again, yet continue to miss them, you might build an association between that pattern and the incorrect movement.
Not good.

Your skills don\'t exist in a vacuum.
If you fail to hit a fast pattern consistently, it may not just be about speed.
It\'s possible that, if you just train reading, you\'ll somehow find a better way to play it, thus lowering the speed requirements.

(Also, you\'ll see why I added `reliable` there in a few sections)

### General accuracy

> General accuracy: Play charts well within your comfort zone (including PST or PRS charts) and try to PM them or improve shiny pure accuracy.

You can also try listening to the song.

Without hitsounds.

The hitsounds can massively fuck up your perception of the rhythm.
Tapping a short section of 1/3 notes as 1/4 notes will make it sound like 1/4 while you\'re playing, despite the LOSTs and FARs you\'re probably getting.

Also, I can\'t believe that I have to say this, but play with sound.
People claiming they\'ve not improved by not hearing the music have probably never played SUPERNOVA or Genesis (From the Chunithm collab).

Also, playing with hitsounds on is usually considered better when playing rhythm games. They help you sync your hitsounds with the music, thus figure out if you\'re early or late.

You should not be playing with your offsets often.
Messing with your offsets too often can make you reliant on it.
Maybe for the first week or month of playing, sure. But, if you keep adjusting it, you might have something wrong. Try just turning off hitsounds, and syncing to your taps.

### Shiny pure accuracy

> Listen to the songs outside of the game.
> Try to get a feel for the rhythms and take note of what patterns are used in a chart.
> If you are trying to get max PMs or come close to doing so, I would strongly advise starting with songs you already know well.
> (If you play Kalpa, then trying out Lunatic Mode in that game may also help since the timing is apparently the same.)

For hopefully obvious reasons, this is quite similar to improving general accuracy.

Since you can\'t adjust judgement timings in Arcaea, the usual method of playing with tighter judgements doesn\'t work here.

### Stamina 2.0

Learning to conserve stamina is just as important as building it.

> Play charts at the upper limits of your comfort zone to push yourself gradually.
> Try not to make exaggerated taps or arm movements; keep your fingers close to the screen.

Remember to tap softly. The harder you tap, the more energy you waste.

> Consider adopting a multifinger playstyle if endurance is a real issue for you, since this will spread the exertion out across more fingers.

I don\'t think that is the main advantage of a multifinger playstyle, but sure. I don\'t play fingers enough to comment.

___

Finally, some advice for thumb players!

Shock. Haven\'t seen that in a long time.

When playing handheld, you can push your screen up with your other fingers to touch your thumb.
For me, it saves quite a bit of stamina, since the exertion is spread to the other 6 fingers that I use to support my phone.

### Tech

There\'s no solid definition for tech charts.

Tech charts are usually just weird to play, or difficult for reasons of "Why can\'t I hit that pattern?" or "Wtf is that pattern?".
Other than that, it\'s difficult to categorise the charts.

Alternate definition. If you see a chart:

- Was charted by Exschwasion,
- Was charted in the past 3 years,
- Was charted by Exschwasion, or
- Was charted by Exschwasion,

It\'s probably a tech chart.

> Tech charts tend to want you to understand them in order to play them well.
> Research them by watching PM (not chart view) videos online before you play, and for songs with complicated rhythms, listen to them repeatedly to ensure you know what to expect from them.

How fun.
