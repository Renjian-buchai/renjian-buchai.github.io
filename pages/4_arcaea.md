# Arcaea

Hi, I play Arcaea. In fact, I\'ve been playing for a short time. Of 7 years. I didn\'t realise it\'s been that long, but I have memories of buying Vicious Labyrinth when it released, and that\'s apparently 7 years ago.

Holy shit, I\'m getting old.

Still potential 11 at the time of writing. Insert skill issue here.

In my defense, I\'m a thumb player, and thumb players are worse at speed. Bengalee is an exception to this.

Because my speed is not ideal, I\'ve spent a large part of my time optimising my movements, analysing charts, and figuring out anomalies. Figuring out anomalies is difficult when you\'re doing it on your own without any help from the official wiki. Ask me how I know.

I play with colourblind mode on, not because I\'m colourblind, but because I prefer the colour scheme.

I can\'t read light-side charts at all.

Axium crisis is the easiest 10+. Fight me on that.

## Tips and Tricks

Most of the tips and tricks are updated from [this blog](https://shizukunoshinden.carrd.co/#arc) by Marina. I do recommend you read it if you want information about pack purchases. The tips and tricks will be repeated here, including anything I have to add.

## Skillsets

As with all rhythm games, the gameplay can be split into different skills.

However, in Arcaea, skillsets are usually split into 2 categories:

### Accuracy

Accuracy is the ability to set \'high score\' plays, usually an EX+ on charts at your current skill level.
Some definitions also claim that PMs are the criteria for the play to be \'high score\'.
Almost no definitions claim that max PMs are the criteria for \'high score\' plays.

Unless you\'re Aploplex.

In the extreme case, the ideal accuracy player could get PM on 9s every time, but get Bs or Cs in 9+s.

___

### Stamina

Unlike other games, Arcaea players consider stamina to be your ability to set average or above scores.

This sounds like a weaker version of accuracy, but stamina is more about your ability to barely pass harder charts.

In the extreme case, the ideal stamina player could AA or low EX every chart, but they can\'t hit EX+ on any chart.

___

It\'s not easy to figure out how good your accuracy or stamina is. It isn\'t necessarily beneficial to find out, either.

You should judge your skill based on your ***average*** ability, **not** your *strongest* ability, **nor** your *weakest* ability!

Potential doesn\'t really say much about whether you\'re an accuracy player, nor a stamina player.
As stated by Marina, you don\'t actually need to play charts >10 until 12.00 ptt, nor PM anything until 12.5 ptt.

Most players tend to be biased towards accuracy, but there\'s nothing wrong with being a stamina player.

___

To improve accuracy, you can try to PM lower-level charts, even PST or PRS charts.
Shiny PURE percentage is an OK gauge of accuracy on charts you have PMed before[^1].

To improve stamina, you can try playing hard charts **that you can read**.
If you can\'t read the chart, please don\'t play it. You\'ll build bad muscle memory[^2]<sup>,</sup>[^3].
