## Arcaea

Stuff related to Arcaea, my beloved 2.0

### ArcCreate Archive

ArcCreate is a fanmade chart editor and Arcaea chart player. I am currently archiving the charts in the chart repositories in the ArcCreate Discord Server.

I have also databased every chart in the archive. From there, I\'ve extracted a handful of observations from the database.

See the latest observations [<ins>here</ins>](https://github.com/ArcCreate-Archival-Team/arccreate-archive/tree/main/stat)

### ArcCreate Charts by Me&trade;

Fanmade charts for Arcaea.

Charts suffixed with ..._conflict are charts that have been converted to the conflict side for accessibility reasons. I say that as someone whose eyes can barely read anything in the Light or Colourless sides.
